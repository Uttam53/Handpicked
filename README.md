## üåü Project Overview

Handpickd offers an alternative to mass-produced goods by highlighting unique, handcrafted items. It's a digital homage to the tradition of artisanry, designed to connect makers with those who appreciate the value of bespoke creations.

## üîß Requirements

Handpickd requires the following tools to run:

-  [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en): A JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
-  [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html): A free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package, mainly used for local development. It also comes preinstalled with MySQL and PHP, which are required for Handpickd.
-  [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/): A tool for dependency management in PHP, allowing you to declare the libraries your project depends on.
-  [Laravel](https://laravel.com/): Version 10, a robust PHP framework for web application development. Which will be installed via Composer

However, because the installation of Laravel and composer can be error-prone when installed via Powershell, it is highly recommended to install it via [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) instead.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

### NodeJS

First, install NodeJS from the link above. Once installed, open up a terminal and run the following command to verify that it has been installed correctly:

```shell
node -v
```

If the command returns a version number, then NodeJS has been installed correctly.

### XAMPP

Next, install XAMPP from the link above. Once installed, open up the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL services. Once started, click on the "Admin" button for MySQL. This will open up a new tab in your browser. Click on the "New" button on the left-hand side and create a new database called "handpickd_db". Once created, click on the "Import" button on the top navigation bar. Click on the "Choose File" button and navigate to the `handpickd_db.sql` file in the root folder of this project. Once selected, click on the "Go" button on the bottom right-hand side. This will import the database into your local MySQL server. Below you will find pictures detailing the steps above.

![XAMMP Install 1](https://github.com/PaperTurtle/handpickd/assets/68080844/0ec2cade-07ec-4e6e-9b0a-140447fa5383)

![XAMPP Install 2](https://github.com/PaperTurtle/handpickd/assets/68080844/74c9092a-97a6-4fd9-a577-44a64e56ab9a)

> Note: The installation of Composer and Laravel will be done via Git Bash, so make sure to install it before proceeding. Errors may occur if you try to install it via Powershell.

### Composer

Next, install Composer from the link above. Once installed, open up a terminal and run the following command to verify that it has been installed correctly:

```shell
composer -v
```

If the command returns a version number, then Composer has been installed correctly.

### Laravel

Next, install Laravel via Composer. Open up a terminal and run the following command:

```shell
composer global require laravel/installer
```

### Change PHP.ini

Lastly, open up the `php.ini` file in the `C:\xampp\php` directory or open the XAMPP Control Panel and click on the Config Button in the Apache Section. Once opened, use STRG + F to search for `extension=gd`. Once found, remove the semicolon in front of it. It should look like this:

```shell
;extension=gd
```

To

```shell
extension=gd
```

Next, navigate to the root folder of the project and open up a terminal. Run the following commands:

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PaperTurtle/handpickd.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd handpickd

# Install dependencies
npm install
composer install

# Set up the environment
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Create a symbolic link to the storage folder (for images)
php artisan storage:link

# Serve the application
php artisan serve // (Terminal 1)
npm run dev // (Terminal 2)
```

Once the application is running, you can access it at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

## üêõ Known Issues

When you run the application, an error may occur stating that an sql driver does not exist. To fix this, download these two files: `php_pdo_sqlsrv_82_ts_x64` and `php_sqlsrv_82_ts_x64` from the [Microsoft SQL Drivers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/php/download-drivers-php-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16). Place them in the following directory: `C:\xampp\php\ext`. Once placed, open up the `php.ini` file in the `C:\xampp\php` directory or open the XAMPP Control Panel and click on the Config Button in the Apache Section and add the following line to the bottom of the file:

```shell
extension=php_pdo_sqlsrv_82_ts_x64
extension=php_sqlsrv_82_ts_x64
```

Once added, save the file and restart the Apache and MySQL services in the XAMPP Control Panel. Once restarted, the application should run without any issues.
